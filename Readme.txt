Instructions:
Run GUI.py

TODO:
-Generalize for Sudoku grids of n by n instead of just 9 by 9. The solution algorithms are already generalized so only GUI needs to be changed.
-Implement partial solution feature, which gives solution for a single square only.
-Implement a feature which checks if there is a unique solution based on current entries in the Sudoku grid.
